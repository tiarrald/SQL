# SQL Project: Pharmaceutical Sales and Drug Analysis

This project analyzes drug, sales, and pharmacy data using SQL to uncover trends in prescription volume, revenue performance, and drug safety reporting.  
These queries demonstrate practical SQL skills including joins, filtering, grouping, aggregation, and real-world business insights relevant to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.

This analysis uses a dataset with three core relational tables:

- Drugs: Drug name, category (e.g., diabetes, blood pressure), unit price, units sold, and reported side effects.
- Pharmacies: Pharmacy names and locations.
- Sales: Tracks which pharmacy sold which drug, how many units were sold, and when.

Analysis

--Which pharmacies sold the most units of each drug?

SELECT Drugs.DrugName,
  Pharmacies.PharmacyName,
  SUM(Sales.UnitsSold) AS TotalUnitsSold
FROM Pharmacies
JOIN Sales
  ON Pharmacies.PharmacyID = Sales.PharmacyID
JOIN Drugs
  ON Sales.DrugID = Drugs.DrugID
GROUP BY Drugs.DrugName, Pharmacies.PharmacyName;

--What is the total revenue generated per drug across all pharmacies?

SELECT Drugs.DrugName,
  SUM(Sales.UnitsSold * Drugs.PricePerUnit) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Sales 
JOIN Drugs
ON Sales.DrugID = Drugs.DrugID
GROUP BY Drugs.DrugName;

--Which drug categories report the most side effects?

SELECT Category,
  SUM(SideEffectReports) AS TotalSideEffects
FROM Drugs
GROUP BY Category;

--Which pharmacy had the highest total sales in February 2023?

SELECT p.PharmacyName,
  SUM(s.UnitsSold * d.PricePerUnit) AS FebruaryRevenue
FROM Sales s
JOIN Drugs d ON s.DrugID = d.DrugID
JOIN Pharmacies p ON s.PharmacyID = p.PharmacyID
WHERE s.SaleMonth = '2023-02'
GROUP BY p.PharmacyName;
