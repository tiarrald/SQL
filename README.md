# Tiarra's SQL Portfolio
## Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository features a collection of SQL queries I've written to explore different datasets and uncover meaningful insights. My goal is to go beyond just writing code, I aim to tell clear, compelling stories through data.

Each query highlights real world thinking: identifying patterns, answering specific questions, and turning raw data into something that informs or inspires.

Feel free to take a look around, and reach out if youâ€™d like to connect!
